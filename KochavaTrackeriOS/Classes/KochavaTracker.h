/*!
 @class KochavaTracker
 
 @brief The class KochavaTracker provides an interface between a host application and Kochava’s Attribution and Analytics Servers.  A tracker manages the exchange of data between these two entities, along with the associated tasks and network transactions.

 @discussion The class KochavaTracker is the main interface for the KochavaTracker SDK.  If you have not already integrated a KochavaTracker SDK into your project, refer to our KochavaTracker iOS SDK support documentation.
 
 You rarely create instances of the KochavaTracker class.  Instead, you configure a provided shared instance using the designated configuration instance method configure(withParametersDictionary:delegate:).
 
 From there, the tracker proceeds to initialize immediately and perform its various tasks.  This is typically done during the earliest phases of the host’s life-cycle, so that installation attribution can be quickly established and post-install events may immediately begin to be queued.
 
 You may alternately create an instance of the KochavaTracker class.  If you do, it is your responsibility to maintain a strong reference.  And if you create multiple instances, it is your responsibility to configure each with a unique storage identifier.

Typically this key does not need to be configured, and the tracker will operate within a default (unqualified) storage location.  However, if multiple trackers are desired then you must specify a different storage identification string for each so that they can maintain persisted data independently.  Typically one tracker is sufficient.  One example use-case for having multiple trackers is when there are two different companies developing a product jointly, such as when a software development house develops an app under contract for an established brand.  Each organization may want independent control of their own analytics, reporting to different Kochava Accounts.  The value you provide will be appended to the names of keys stored within NSUserDefaults standard user defaults, so it should be a simple string and not too verbose.

 @discussion This is the preferred way of using a tracker.  To complete the integration you must call configureWithParametersDictionary:delegate:.  You may alternatively use the designated initializer to create your own tracker.  The shared instance provides a few benefits.  First, it simplifies your implementation as you do not need to store an instance to the tracker somewhere in a public location in your own code.  Second, it ensures that if your code unintentionally tries to make use of the shared instance prior to configuration that you can receive a warning in the log from the tracker.  If you use your own property to store the tracker, and it is nil, then this provision would not be automatically available to you.
