 @method + productWithAPIVersionString:buildDateString:bundleIdentifierString:compilerFlagNameStringArray:compilerFlagPredicateSubstitutionVariablesDictionary:nameString:organizationNameString:reverseDomainNameString:versionString:
 
 @brief Constructs an instance of class KVAProduct.
 
 @param apiVersionString An optional API version string.  This property is used to establish API compatibility between products.  API compatibility is assumed to be assured when the value compares to be equal for all products with the same organizationNameString.
 
 @param buildDateString An optional string containing the date when the product was built.  It is recommended that you source this a compile time.  The format is optional, but it is recommended that you provide the date in an ISO 8601 date string.
 
 @param bundleIdentifierString A string containing the bundle identifier associated with this product.  This property may be used to cross-reference this product from a Class.  Logging uses this to take the class for a LogMessage and lookup the associated Product.
 
 @param bundleTypeString The bundle type.  Examples:  "app", "xcframework", "static library".
 
 @param compilerFlagNameStringArray An array containing strings which are the names of compiler flags.
 
 @param compilerFlagPredicateSubstitutionVariablesDictionary A dictionary containing substitution variables for use with an NSPredicate containing compiler flags.
 
 @param moduleNameString The name of the module.  Example:  "KochavaCore".
 
 @param nameString A name string.  Example: "AppleCore".
 
 @param organizationNameString A string containing the name of the organization representing the product.  Example:  "Kochava".
 
 @param reverseDomainNameString A string containing a reverse domain name style representation of the name of the product.  This is used in the definition of keys for persistent storage, dispatch queues, etc.  Example:  "com.kochava.KochavaCore".
 
 @param versionString A version string.
 
 Swift example:
 @code
 let product = KVAProduct(
     apiVersionString: "1",
     buildDateString: nil,
     bundleIdentifierString: Bundle(for: type(of: self)).bundleIdentifier,
     bundleTypeString: "xcframework",

/*!
 @method - register
 
 @brief Registers the product.
 
 @discussion Generally Kochava products automatically register themselves, but there are a few exceptions.  If you're using a product which is optional and weakly linked, this method should be called once, early, to register the product for use.  One such example is the product KochavaLocation.  As a weakly-linked optional product, it would be optimized away by the linker if a call to register it was not explicitly made and if there were no other explicit interactions early with its API.  For products which automtically register themselves calling this method is redundant and will have no effect.  Important Note:  The existence of a product will not be recognized by the SDK until it has been registered.  It is important therefore to register the product before configuring an instance of class KVATracker to ensure that it is recognized by the SDK at the time when it may be needed;  however, that having been said, some products if registered immediately afterward will still be guaranteed to be recognized in time due to architectural considerations designed to avoid a race condition.  You should not assume that registering a product after configuring a tracker is guaranteed to work properly.
