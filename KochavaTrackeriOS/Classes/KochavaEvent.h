 @class KochavaEvent
 
 @brief A class that stores standardized parameters for an event.
 
 @discussion This class is used to store and pass standardized parameters when sending a post-install event to the server.  The proper use of this class is to instantiate an object using the designated initializer, and then to assign values to each property that you wish to send.  You may then pass this object as a parameter to sendEvent.

 If the string passed is all numeric (and may include a decimal point), Kochava will automatically sum the amounts passed for the same nameString.  For example, if you sent the purchase amount of in-app purchases in infoString and named nameString âIAP â Purchase Priceâ, Kochava would add up all the purchase amounts for you and present them as a total for âIAP â Purchase Priceâ.  Regardless of what is passed in infoString, Kochavaâs user dashboard will let you access all the data passed in infoString for any nameString, and present a count of all times an event was sent passing any given nameString.
 
 NOTE: If you pass a string of JSON represented data, only the root level (no nested chunks) is stored.  Also, a limit of 75 characters is applied for a non-JSON-decodable string passed as an event infoString.
