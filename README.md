## KochavaTracker iOS SDK

The KochavaTracker iOS SDK allows advertisers to integrate a single SDK to leverage the hundreds of ad network and publisher partners integrated with Kochava. This limits the number of 3rd party SDKs required to run a successful UA strategy and greatly reduces complexity during update cycles.

Kochava is a leading mobile attribution and analytics platform.
