 @method + kva_object:isEqualToObject:
 
 @brief A method to compare two objects for equality, which provides for the possibility that either object may be nil.
 
 @discussion Although you can test two objects for equality by using the isEqual: method directly, that comparison will fail if both strings are nil.  In contrast, this method will safely return true if both objects are nil.  It will also recognize when one object is nil and the other is not nil that they are not equal.

/*!
 @method + kva_fromObject:class:
 
 @brief Returns a native object for a class from another object.
 
 @param object An object which may or may not be a native class object, with the hope that it may not be but may be convertable to one.  Non-native objects are typically instances of NSDictionary or NSArray which were created from a call to an asForContextObjectWithContext method.  They may also have originated from external sources, such as servers, and often are valid JSON.

 @param aClass The target class.  This parameter is optional.  When omitted the class to use will be inferred from kva_fromObject, if possible.  This typically becomes possible when kva_fromObject is a dictionary which contains a key "$class" which specifies the class, or else when kva_fromObject is an array of objects which can be similarly resolved.  When this parameter is passed, it takes precedence over these specifications, and will enforce the class by attempting to create an object from the specified class.  If kva_fromObject is not truly an object which can be converted to the class, the results may be less than desireable, as you should generally expect to end up with an object of the specified class which is relatively unconfigured (or nil altogether).
 
 @param elementClass A target class for any elements.  This parameter is optional.  This parameter generally applies to cases of class where the class would have elements, such as arrays and sets.  The rules for how this is used is identical to class, except applied to any elements within the class.
 
 @discussion If an object cannot be converted then kva_fromObject will be returned as-is, making this method safe to be used on any object to see if it can be brought into a native class object.

/*!
 @method + kva_sanitizedNameStringForClass
 
 @discussion Occasionally when we receive an object back from the operating system, it has an unexpected class.  It's usually some low-level or undocumented class that is supposed to behave equivalently to the class we expect, but the problem is that these names are not safe to be persisted.  A future operating system could come along with a new underlying class name and have no support for the previous one.  This method santizes for the things we know about.
