> ##### Note
>
> Prior to version 3.16.0 released in April 2020, library KochavaCore was bundled within module KochavaTracker, which made its integration automatic.  This changed when it was broken out into its own module so that it could be used independently with other modules such as KochavaConsent, KochavaEngagementExtension, and KochavaEntitlements, without requiring the integration of module KochavaTracker.  As a dependency of all modules within the Kochava SDK, you should integrate and update module KochavaCore alongside any other modules which you use.  Package managers such as Cocoapods make this automatic through their dependency management system;  however, when using Direct Downloads such as through Bintray this falls to you.  It is important to always download current versions of each module which you choose to integrate so that compatibility is ensured.
